# Mood Muzik
A personal project I'm developing to give me experience with building full stack web applications and hosting them on cloud services.

Written in Python with Django as the web framework. Currently testing on local machine.

Dependencies can be installed with pip and homebrew
Python: `brew install python`
Django: `pip install django`
