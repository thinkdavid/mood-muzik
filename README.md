# Mood Muzik
A personal project I'm developing to give me experience with building full stack web applications and hosting them on cloud services.

Written in Python with Django as the web framework. Currently testing on local machine.

Dependencies can be installed with pip and homebrew  
Python: `brew install python3`  
Django: `pip3 install django`  

To run the application, after having installed dependencies:  
`cd MoodMuzik/moodmuzik`  
`python3 manage.py runserver`  
Then, navigate to localhost:8000/*any view defined in moodmuzik/moodmuzik/urls.py*
